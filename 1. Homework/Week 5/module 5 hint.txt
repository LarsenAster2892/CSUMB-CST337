First, Watch the video "Reading and writing with the Arduino" on iLearn.

The video describes how to connect and how to read in a certain digital pin if there are 5V or 0V. Our digital pins can be set on read or write. 
Normally, you do that in the setup() function. The video shows how to determine if there are 5V or not, 
depending on a switch being pressed. On another pin, which is set to "write", a LED is on depending on the input pin.

Copy the principle and do our schematic, see the 2 pictures at iLearn under "homework hint". 
What we do is basically exact the schematic from the video, but we have 4 times an input pin and 2 times an output pin. 
Reading and writing works the same way, just don't forget: Every pin has a certain  number.
In our case, we read 2 pins from a 2 Bit number A (determined by pressing the 2 switches) and 2 pins from number B. 
You have to write the C-Arduino code, so that a 2 Bit adder is simulated. 
So ask yourself, whats the truthtable for the 4 input Bits and the 2 output Bits ? 
Whats 00 + 00 ? 00+ 01? 00 + 10? and so on. That you have to write to the 2 output pins which are connected to 2 LEDs (with 2 resistors I hope).

In case you ruined a switch, take cables and connect / don't connect them on the video.
