/*
 Fade

 This example shows how to fade an LED on pin 9
 using the analogWrite() function.

 The analogWrite() function uses PWM, so if
 you want to change the pin you're using, be
 sure to use another PWM capable pin. On most
 Arduino, the PWM pins are identified with 
 a "~" sign, like ~3, ~5, ~6, ~9, ~10 and ~11.

 This example code is in the public domain.

 /* function declaration */
void FadeOn( int currLed);

// named constant for the switch pin
const int switchPin = 8;
const int startLed = 2;
const int maxLed = 7;
const long waitTime = 10000;

int led = 9;           // the PWM pin the LED is attached to
int brightness = 0;    // how bright the LED is
int fadeAmount = 5;    // how many points to fade the LED by
int currLed = 2;
int prevLed = 2;


// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // declare pin 9 to be an output:
  for (currLed = startLed; currLed <= maxLed; currLed++)
  {
   pinMode(curLed, OUTPUT);   
  }
  currLed = startLed;

  // set the tilt switch pin as input
  pinMode(switchPin, INPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop()
{
  
  FadeOn(currLed);
  delay(waitTime);
  if (++currLed > maxLed)
  {
    currLed = startLed;
  }
}

void FadeOn( int currLed)
{
   pinMode(currLed, OUTPUT);
  for ( brightness = 0; brightness < 255; brightness++)

       analogWrite(led, brightness);
